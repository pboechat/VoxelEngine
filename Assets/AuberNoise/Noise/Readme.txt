v1.0
Initial release.
v1.1
Added texture creator plugin.(Saving is disabled at the moment)

HOW TO USE:
This is an exact implementation of LibNoise for c++ to be used with Unity3D.
The documentation at http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/ applies for this pack as well.
There are some differences with NoiseUtils, check the Tutorials and examples folder,
those scripts are the same tutorials on libnoise site.
Also an example granite texture is provided.

If you compare the tutorial code for libnoise and my tutorial code,
so you can understand the small differences in between.

TEXTURE CREATOR PLUGIN:
*Click on the menu Aubergine/TextureCreator
*First you must add your noise modules from Module options.
Every module has different options. After you are done with the options,
you must click on Add to List. Then you will see your new module on the,
modules list on the left.
You can delete individual modules by choosing Module to Delete[list number here]
and clicking on Delete Module button.

*After you are satisfied, you can set your texture height and width from Texture Options.
Also can give a name for your texture, but for this release saving textures is disabled.

*Then you can set your Render options and click on Render Colors or Render Normals
to see your newly generated texture.
Several options are pretty obvious on what they do.

*If you want to set some terrain heights, you must choose the terrain in your hierarchy
first then click on Set Terrain Heights.

Thats the basic usage. For any further help and questions, please use the appropriate forum post at:

KNOWN ISSUES:
Although they dont lack of functioning as is; RendererImage and RendererNormal
could be improved for usability.

Texture Creator Plugin saving is temporarily disabled.
